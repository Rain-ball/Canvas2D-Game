# Space Invasion

Space Invasion is a single player game developed by AY_KE from IMKAT Coders. This game is inspired by [Starblast](https://starblast.io) by Neuronality. 

## How to play

Use mouse to aim and left mouse click to shoot. Once you join a game, enemies will start spawning from all directions at rate of 1 enemy per second. Small enemies are fast and big enmies have high shields.

If you hit a fairly small enemy, then it dies with 1 shot. But bigger enemies will shrink down when shot and to kill them, you will need to shoot it quit a few times.

If any enemy touches you, then the game stops immediately, and 1 message pops up which displays your overall score and frag count.

You get 10 points per kill.

Enjoy killing enemies!
